## 📍 Overview

TIME is a modern web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It leverages the power of tRPC for type-safe API communication and Drizzle ORM for database interactions. This project aims to provide a robust and scalable foundation for building time management and workflow optimization tools.

---

## 👾 Features

- Next.js 14+ with App Router for efficient server-side rendering and routing
- TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience
- Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive UI development
- tRPC for end-to-end typesafe APIs
- Drizzle ORM for flexible and performant database operations
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
- GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
- Customizable components with shadcn/ui
